Types for simulation constituents.

The simulation needs a few things with different combinations of some basic
capabilities. This module contains base classes for these:
    - `Loadable` objects can be added to the simulation using their `load
      <Loadable.load>` function, or equivalently `Simulation.load`. This does
      not mean that they actually have to show up anywhere in the simulation;
      they could also just register (parts of) themselves for reporting or
      updating, such as for example the `Reporter`.
    - `Reportable` objects can produce a summary of themselves for simulation
      output. For a simple particle, this would probably just be the position
      (i.e. simply a float), but in principle this could be anything.
    - `Updateable` objects are those that actually interact when the simulation
      is running. They provide information on when they have to be updated
      next, and a function to do so. For convenience, the base class also
      defines a few functions to interact with the simulation's update queue.
      Note that these do not necessarily have to be objects of the simulation
      logic, but simply represent anything that needs action at simulation
      runtime. Examples include `Event` and `Reporter`.
    - `Events <Event>` can be submitted to the simulation's update queue to
      execute arbitrary tasks at a specified time. They are mainly used for
      unloading of things, since its better to do this in a separate step, than
      in the middle of an update cycle.
    - `Particles <Particle>` are the things that live on the track, i.e. the
      "actual particles being simulated". See `baseparticles` for some usage
      patterns, and consult the example script for examples of concrete
      Particle implementations.

    Base class for particles living on the track

    Attributes
    ----------
    position : int, optional
        my position on the track. Set at (or after) initialization to load at
        that position. If not specified, a position will be chosen at random at
        `load` time.

    Examples
    --------
    One way to set up a `Particle` with a finite lifetime would be to submit a
    timed `Event` when the particle loads:
    >>> class FiniteLifeParticle(Particle):
    ...     def load(self, sim):
    ...         super().load(sim)
    ...         sim.load(Event(self.unload, random.expovariate(10)))

    Alternatively, if you want the option of changing the life time
    mid-simulation, you can implement it as a separate counter:
    >>> class FiniteMutableLifeParticle(Particle):
    ...     def __init__(self, lifetime=float('inf'), **kwargs):
    ...         super().__init__(**kwargs)
    ...         self.lifetime = lifetime
    ...
    ...     def nextUpdate(self, sim):
    ...         return min(self.lifetime, super().nextUpdate(sim))

    ...         self.lifetime -= sim.time - self.lastUpdate
    ...         if self.lifetime < 1e-10: # small positive threshold for numerical safety
    ...             sim.load(Event(self.unload))
    ...
    ...         super().update(sim)

    Note that in an actual use case (for both implementations), you might want
    to also modify `unload` to submit a loading `Event` for a new particle.

    Edit: by now, exactly the second implementation exists as
    `baseparticles.FiniteLife`. Note that this doesn't even have to be a
    `Particle`, it just has to be `Updateable` and `Loadable`.
