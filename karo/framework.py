"""
The backbone of the library.

This module sets up the framework to run 1d simulations in a reasonably
straight forward manner. Overarching everything is the `Simulation` class. It
is the centralized storage for everything and actually runs the simulation.

Naturally there are many moving parts within the simulation, so there are a few
helper types to keep these organized. These helper types are collected in the
`constituents` module. It includes base classes for `Updateable` things,
`Reportable` ones, `Particles <Particle>`, `Events <Event>`, etc. I would
recommend reading its docstring now.

Continuing with the contents of this module, `Track` provides the playing field
for the simulation. We use a `BoundSafeList` (such that we can easily query
neighbors etc., without having to take care not to run out of bounds) whose
entries are simple lists of references to `Updateable` objects. It is thus
possible to implement logics where particles occupy the same space on the
track. The main reason to subclass `BoundSafeList` here is to provide the
`Track.remove` method, which cleanly removes an object from wherever it appears
on the track. Ideally this would only be used as a fallback, since it scales
with system size; in principle, objects should be able to keep track of their
own references and delete them when prompted to do so.

The `Collider` class is probably the central ingredient to the flexibility of
the framework. It stores the actions to take when things collide on the track,
and provides a method to resolve the collision logic, given the two colliding
particles. Note that this resolution is such that **all** matching rules apply,
i.e. if a `Walker` collides with a `Boundary` (both of which are subclasses of
`Particle`), the collider will execute the rules for ``Walker <--> Boundary``,
``Particle <--> Boundary``, ``Walker <--> Particle``, and ``Particle <-->
Particle``, as long as the corresponding rules are specified. For more details,
see the `collisionrules` submodule.

Finally, the `Reporter` class keeps track of the generated data. Objects that
should be included in the report have to be registered with the reporter; this
is done automatically by `Loadable.load`, as long as the `Loadable` object is
also `Reportable`. Note that there are two modes of reporting: event-based,
i.e. report whenever anything changes, or (because this might produce a lot of
unnecessary data) time-based, i.e. report at fixed time intervals. `Simulation`
chooses the right type of reporting based on the `!dt` argument to its
constructor. Set this to some number for regular reporting at that time
interval, or to ``None`` for event-based reporting. Note that at runtime, the
simulation will notify the reporter about events, if it is an instance of
`EventBasedReporter`. Thus, if you want to write your own event-based reporter,
subclass this one.

class Simulation:
    """
    Contains all structure and the main loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    L : int
        total length of the track that everything runs on
    collider : Collider, optional
        the collection of collision rules
    dt : float, optional
        reporting time step. Set to ``None`` (default) to report all events
        whenever they happen.
    markEnds : bool, optional
        whether to put `TrackEnd` markers at the first and last positions of
        the track. These will (usually) prevent things from falling off the
        track.

    Attributes
    ----------
    time : float
        absolute simulation time
    nextUpdates : OrderedLinkedList
        the update queue. 
    track : Track
        the track everything lives on
    reporter : Reporter
        reporter reports things
    collider : Collider
        collider collides things

    Notes
    -----
    `nextUpdates` is kept in absolute simulation time, while
    `Updateable.update` returns time until next event. The queue could be kept
    in relative time (i.e.  storing time until the requested update, instead of
    the absolute time when that update should happen) using
    `OrderedLinkedList.movet`, but that function is O(n), so probably not worth
    the effort.

    Examples
    --------
    Using the particles defined in the `baseparticles` module, we can setup a
    small simulation of "bouncy" particles:
    >>> sim = Simulation(L=100, dt=None) # event-based reporting
    ... for i in range(10):
    ...     sim.load(Walker(speed=np.pi**(i/10)))
    ... sim.collider.register(Walker, Particle, collisionrules.reflect)
    ... sim.run(50)

    Note that in an actual simulation setting where you might have other,
    non-reflecting walkers, you might want to subclass `Walker` to have a
    specific type that reflects off other particles:
    >>> class GummyBear(Walker):
    ...     pass
    ... ### sim.collider.register(Walker, Particle, collisionrules.reflect)
    ... sim.collider.register(GummyBear, Particle, collisionrules.reflect)
