Collection of stepping rules

This module contains a few exemplatory stepping rules for use with
`baseparticles.Walker`.

A stepping rule has signature ``rule(obj, sim) -> <list or None>``. Their job
is twofold: check whether a `Walker` should take a step, and determine any
actions that should be taken immediately before the step. The rule itself
should not modify anything, just run through the logic and return a to-do list,
i.e. a list of actions, where ``action(sim) -> None``. Returning an empty list
means "do take the step, but no pre-processing necessary". If the step should
not be taken, the rule should ``return None`` (which is equivalent to a missing
``return`` statement).
